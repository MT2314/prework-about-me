      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am working towards becoming a noob at code creation. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Ukraine, and imigrated to Canada at the age of 7.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p> 1. Coding! even though i know very little about it whenever i start some little project i lose track of time . 
      </br>2. Being out in the wild on my own, portaging, camping and anything to do with exploring the unknown, preferably on my own.  
    </br> 3. Learning about History, Psychology and Religion is something that i constantly find myself gravitating towards.  </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would involve somoe sort of creation. Having an infinite array of potential, focusing on some of the available variables and alligning them in 
        such a way that is both beautiful and useful to me and if I am fortunate to the community around me. I especially would love to work in VR, creating stories 
        or creating Websites that would fit within the VR enviornment. If i was to be specific I would love to allow people to tell stories online and connect them to old parables 
        or tales that relate to their stories. I believe that this would be a wonderful way for poeple to develop their charachters, work hrough their issues and find meaning and connection
        to the world and the past. 
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p> I am now a proud citizen of Canada and live in the beautiful city of Toronto.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have chosen web development specifically because I love the ideas of portals and rooms that can be accessed by anybody on the planet. We now live in a time
        where almost every citizen of earth has access to the World Wide Web. I believe that the internet is nowhere near its full potential, and there is no reason why all software created 
        by any person in the world cant live and be accessed through a link. I am especially excited about the posibilities of combining the Internet with Virtual Reality.
